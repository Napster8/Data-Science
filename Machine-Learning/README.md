* COVID-19 - Age as a Risk Factor to predict survival rate - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Napster8/Data-Science/tree/Napster8/Machine-Learning/12-Covid-Age-Risk-Factor)

### Statistical Projects:

Just because you can use numerous machine learning models, tune hyper-parameters using Grid or Randomize searching techniques and use soft voting techniques to finally arrive at ensemble model that has the highest accuracy to get the job done, does not mean, you should. 

Core idea must be to solve the business problem. This project has been a cornerstone to learn just that.
