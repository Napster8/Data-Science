# Google COVID-19 Dashboard Enhanced

## See how your community is moving around differently due to COVID-19 

A few days ago, I discovered Google introducing a really interesting [dashboard](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), but did not have a moving average within it. 
So I enhanced the same and posted it in the Tableau Public.

These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. 
The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different  categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, 
parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.
